What exactly is this `.archive` directory?

The `.archive` directory is a temporary holding location for files that we do
not want to be active, but we don't necessarily want to delete (yet). Some of
them may return to the codebase, others will be sent to the bit bucket. Only
time and the scales of Anubis will determine their ultimate fate.
