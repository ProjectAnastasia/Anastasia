# Anastasia Code of Conduct

This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for all contributors to the Anastasia repository. We believe in fostering a welcoming, respectful, and collaborative environment.

## General Expectations

- **Assume Good Faith**: Everyone is here to improve the project. Approach discussions and contributions with the assumption that others are acting in good faith.
- **Be Respectful**: Treat others with courtesy and professionalism. Disagreements are natural, but personal attacks, hostility, or toxic behavior will not be tolerated.
- **Stay Relevant**: Keep comments and discussions focused on the issue or pull request at hand. Avoid derailing conversations or introducing unrelated topics.
- **Communicate Early and Often**: If you're planning a major change, talk to the maintainers first. This saves everyone time and ensures your contribution aligns with the project's goals.

## Contribution Guidelines

- **Test Your Work**: Submissions should be tested before opening a pull request. Unverified changes or those that fail CI checks are unlikely to be merged.
- **Engage Constructively**: Offer feedback on contributions in a constructive manner. Critique the work, not the person.
- **Avoid Disruption**: Do not be disruptive or create contentious pull requests simply to prove a point or settle grievances.

## Maintainers’ Role

- Maintainers have the final say on all pull requests and issues.
- While feedback is encouraged, maintainers may choose to merge, close, or defer contributions based on their judgment of the project’s best interests.
- Decisions made by maintainers should be respected. If you have concerns, raise them constructively.

## Enforcement

Failure to adhere to these guidelines may result in a warning, removal from discussions, or a ban from the repository at the maintainers’ discretion.

Let’s work together to make Anastasia an enjoyable and productive project for everyone.
