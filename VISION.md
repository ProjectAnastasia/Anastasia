# VISION.md

Welcome to **Anastasia Station**, a remote outpost of the **Union of Soviet Socialist Planets**.

Life here is tough--bureaucracy is slow, the equipment is decades old, and the reactor always
seems one meltdown away from disaster. But the work must go on. Whether you're a loyal officer,
a weary worker, or a scheming opportunist, everyone has a role to play in keeping the station
(and themselves) in one piece.

## What To Expect

**Soviet Atmosphere**  
Inspired by late-Soviet aesthetics, bureaucracy, and daily struggles--grim, clunky, and sometimes
absurd.  
It’s all for the fun of the setting, not a history lesson or political statement.

**Engaging Roleplay**  
Get into character, tell stories, and keep it moving. No walls of text.

**Classic Combat**  
Bringing back old-school stun-based fights. No bullet-sponging stamina combat--if you get the drop
on someone, it matters. Quick, brutal, and to the point.

**Explore the Void**  
Brave cosmonauts can take space pods beyond the station to explore, salvage wrecks, or disappear
into the unknown.

**The Gateway**  
A portal to unknown worlds, offering scientists the chance to recover rare artifacts; valuable,
dangerous, and vital for research.

## What NOT To Expect

**ERP**  
Keep it clean, comrade.

**HRP**  
We love immersive roleplay, but it’s all about enjoying the experience without the pressure of
super long paragraphs and no action.

**Powergaming & Min-Maxing**  
This isn’t a competition. Play your role, not just the mechanics. Winning at all costs is neither
glorious nor fun.

**Modern Convenience**  
The station is held together by duct tape and stubbornness. Don’t expect sleek, user-friendly
tech—everything is a little janky, a little slow, and a little unpredictable.

**Competent Leadership**  
Your department head might be a washed-up officer coasting on old favors. Your captain might
be an out-of-touch bureaucrat more concerned with paperwork than safety. Expect flawed leadership,
not flawless efficiency.

**Nanotrasen Corporate Culture**  
No NT here, tovarishch. The Union runs on collective struggle, not corporate greed. No bluesuits,
no loyalty implants—just state-issued incompetence and the ever-present hand of the Party.

**A Station That Works Properly**  
The equipment is ancient, the bureaucracy is sluggish, and everything is held together by desperation
and ingenuity. A smoothly running station is a utopian dream.

**A Safe Work Environment**  
Between reactor leaks, faulty wiring, and the occasional political purge, safety regulations
are more of a suggestion than a reality.

**Simple Solutions**  
Every problem has at least three layers of unnecessary paperwork, outdated procedures, and
someone in a bad mood making things worse.
