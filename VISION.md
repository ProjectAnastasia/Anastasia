# VISION.md

Welcome to **Anastasia Station**, a remote outpost of the **Union of Soviet Socialist Planets**.
Life here is tough -- bureaucracy is slow, the equipment is decades old, and the reactor always
seems one meltdown away from disaster. But the work must go on. Whether you're a loyal officer,
a weary worker, or a scheming opportunist, everyone has a role to play in keeping the station
(and themselves) in one piece.

## What To Expect

**Soviet Atmosphere**  
Inspired by late-Soviet aesthetics, bureaucracy, and daily struggles—grim, clunky, and sometimes
absurd. It’s all for the fun of the setting, not a history lesson or political statement.

**Engaging Roleplay**  
Get into character, tell stories, and keep it moving. No walls of text.

**Classic Combat**  
Bringing back old-school stun-based fights. No bullet-sponging stamina combat.

**Explore the Void**  
Brave cosmonauts can take space pods beyond the station to explore, salvage wrecks, or disappear
into the unknown.

**The Gateway**  
A portal to unknown worlds, offering scientists the chance to recover rare artifacts; valuable,
dangerous, and vital for research.

## What NOT To Expect

**ERP**  
Keep it clean, comrade.

**HRP**  
We love immersive roleplay, but it’s all about enjoying the experience without the pressure of
super long paragraphs and no action.

**Stamina Combat**  
We’re sticking to the old-school stun-based combat. No drawn-out stamina fights--if you get the
drop on someone, it matters. Quick, brutal, and to the point.
